title = "High-Level Professional"
description = "If you have spent at least five years in a row living legally in Taiwan (or three if you are married to a Taiwanese citizen), and have studied a bit of Chinese, you can apply for Taiwanese citizenship. You may become a full citizen  immediately after application, without renouncing your existing citizenships."

## Process Overview

The process for Taiwanese citizenship application as a High-Level professional is at first glance, painfully simple:

1. Apply to your favourite (central) government ministry for a letter of recommendation that acknowledges you as a high-level professional fit for naturalisation
2. Apply for naturalisation as a high-level professional at your local household registration office.

It is, of course, much more difficult in practice.


## Recommendation Lettter 
The first step to take is to start gathering documents from across your whole career to support
  your application. It's my experience that it's preferred that these documents should be independently
  verifiable. That means that in theory, the government has a source unrelated to you they could use to
  check the information is legitimate (eg calling a company on a letterhead). 

You will need to construct your application based on the requirements of the ministry to which you
  are applying.
Read the information in the link above and then call that Ministry and ask for advice about their
 requirements. Once you know which Ministry will assess your work, you can then craft an application
 letter on the official form introducing yourself, your skills, and your contributions to Taiwan.
 The latter part is particularly important for the second step of the application process, since
 you will be assessed a second time by the citizenship committee in the Ministry of Interior.


## Residence Requirement
In general, you must be resident in Taiwan for more than 183 days a year for at least 
 five continuous years, or three if you are married to a Taiwanese citizen.
 You do not need to hold permanent residence (APRC), but this does waive certain
 requirements, as does spending more than 10 consecutive years resident in Taiwan.

It is crucial that:
* You are legally resident in Taiwan, with an ARC, for this time
* There are no gaps in your residence (even a single day without ARC can render you ineligible)
* The purpose of your residence is for professional work or as a spouse - time spent as a student, 'blue collar' worker, medical treatment, visa exempt etc does not count
* You have not broken the law in relation to visas and residence (eg overstaying your visa)

You may apply at the National Immigration Agency for a "Certificate of Residence" that will provide
 the necessary details for your application.

## Language Ability
You must prove a basic level of Chinese language ability in order to qualify for naturalization.
You have two options: take a test, or study a certain number of hours in a recognised school.

The test can be of multiple choice written form in Mandarin or in oral form in Mandardin, Taiwanese, Hakka
 or an indigenous language. Either option is 20 questions, selected at random from a pre-defined pool of around 200.
You must score:
* 70% for a standard application
* 60% if your spouse is Taiwanese, have resideded in Taiwan for more than 10 years, or were born here and one of your parents is Taiwanese
* 50% if you are aged 65 years or older

Information about the test, including the bank of potential questions, is found on the
 [Department of Household Registration website](https://www.ris.gov.tw/app/portal/229).


The alternative is to study a certain number of hours in a government recognised school and present a certificate
 to validate your attendance. You need:
* 200 hours for a standard application
* 100 hours if you were adopted by a Taiwanese citizen, were born in Taiwan, are the guardian of a Taiwanese national, or have spent more than 10 years in Taiwan
* 72 hours if you have a Taiwanese parent, married a Taiwanese national(including if you are divorced or your spouse died), have Taiwanese children or are aged 65 years or older


## Proof of Funds or Ability
If you already have Permanent Residence (APRC) in Taiwan, you are exempt from proving your personal
 finances. For everyone else, you must gather documents such as tax records, pay slips and bank
 statements that show you have one of:
* A salary above twice the minimum wage (i.e. >NT$47,600 as of 2020)
* Property or funds worth more than NT$5 million
* A Taiwan-recognised professional/technical skill certificate or license
* Proof you are employed in the high-tech industry

If you are married to a Taiwanese national or have Taiwanese children, requirements
 are lower.


## Criminal Record Check
You must have a clean criminal record in both your existing country of citizenship and Taiwan.

You must apply for a criminal record check in your existing country of citizenship and:
1. have this certified by the Taiwanese diplomatic mission responsible for that country/state
1. translate the document into Chinese
1. have the translated document certified by a Taiwanese notary public
1. have the certified document notarized by the Bureau of Consular Affairs in Taiwan


Once your criminal record is issued by your existing country of citizenship, you cannot leave
 Taiwan, otherwise it will be deemed invalid.
