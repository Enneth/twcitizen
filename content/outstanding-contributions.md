## Qualification
Application for citizenship through Outstanding Contributions to Taiwan are very rare.
 Generally, the applicants have spent decades making significant and selfless efforts
 towards improving one or more aspects of Taiwan. If you're finding this out from this
 website rather than talking to your friends in the government, you're probably not
 qualified ;)


However, in theory, there is a standardized process and set of requirements. If you
 meet any of the following, you must ask the government agency or organisation responsible
 to provide certifying documents and a letter of recommendation. Submit these on
[the form](https://www.ris.gov.tw/documents/data/en/2/Directions-for-Identifying-a-Foreign-National-or-a-Stateless-Person-Who-has-Made-Special-Contributions-to-the-ROC.pdf)
 with information about your special contributions to your local Household Registration Office.
