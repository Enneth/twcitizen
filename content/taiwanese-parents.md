## Introduction
There is an important conceptual difference in Taiwanese citizenship compared to that of other countries.
 Essentially, Taiwan only has the concept of a "national", and what most of us think of as the rights of
 a citizen are tied with what is known as "Household Registration". Nationals with full residence and
 voting rights are known as "Nationals with Household Registration".

There are many Taiwanese nationals living overseas, who may be unaware they are Taiwanese, because they
 do not have the right to live or work in Taiwan without taking some additional steps. These are known as
 "Nationals without Household Registration" (NWOHR).

If you have Taiwanese parents and want to acquire Taiwanese citizenship, the first step you need to take
 is to determine whether they ever held Household Registration. Try and find that document and bring it
 to your local Taiwanese diplomatic post, who can provide advice on how to proceed.

There are many nuances here, including which of your parents was Taiwanese and when you were born.
 We will add additional details soon.
