## Introduction
Taiwanese nationality is based on the principle of *jus sanguinis* - passed on by blood.
If your parents are Taiwanese nationals it is very likely you are too, automatically.

However, there is an important conceptual difference in Taiwanese citizenship compared to that of other countries.
 Essentially, Taiwan only has the concept of a "national", and what most of us think of as the rights of
 a citizen are tied with what is known as "Household Registration". Nationals with full residence and
 voting rights are known as "Nationals with Household Registration".

There are many Taiwanese nationals living overseas, who may be unaware they are Taiwanese, because they
 do not have the right to live or work in Taiwan without taking some additional steps. These are known as
 "Nationals without Household Registration" (NWOHR). NWOHR's can have Taiwan passports, but they lack
 a national ID number (which significantly reduces the usefulness of the passport).

If you have Taiwanese parents and want to acquire Taiwanese citizenship, the first step you need to take
 is to determine whether they ever held Household Registration. Try and find that document and bring it
 to your local Taiwanese diplomatic post, who can provide advice on how to proceed.

There are many nuances here, including which of your parents was Taiwanese and when and where you were born.

## Process overview
Generally, there are four steps involved in acquiring Taiwanese citizenship for those with Taiwanese parents:
1. Applying for a Taiwan (NWOHR) passport from your local Taiwanese embassy
1. Enter Taiwan using your Taiwan (NWOHR) passport
1. (sometimes) Apply for a Taiwan Area Residence Certificate (TARC) and live in Taiwan for 1-5 years
1. Register a Household Registration (定居) to become a full citizen

What documents you will need at each step, and whether you need to live in Taiwan for a period before
 getting your Taiwanese ID will depend on your age and the status of your parents.

## Information for Minors
If you are under 20 years old, and your parents have active Household Registrations,
 you may follow a simpler process. You will not have to apply for a
 Taiwan Area Residence Certificate (TARC) and may proceed directly to Household Registration.

## Applying for a Taiwan (NWOHR) passport
You can apply for a Taiwan passport is done at your local Taiwanese diplomatic mission.
In addition to your passport photos, tou will likely need some of the following documents:
* Your birth certificate
* You parent's marriage certificate
* Your parent's household registration, ID card, passport and/or birth certificate

Any of these documents from a country other than Taiwan need to be certified by the
Taiwanese diplomatic mission responsible for the area where the document was produced.
For example, if you were born in Los Angeles, USA; then the TECO in Los Angeles needs to certify your
 birth certificate.

## About the Taiwan Area Residence Certificate (TARC)
If you are a National without Household Registration (NWOHR), you must apply for a TARC and 
reside in Taiwan for:
* one year, without departure
* two years, for more than 270 days a year
* five years, for more than 183 days a year
prior to being able to apply for Household Registration.

 Instructions are available [in Chinese](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/5382/5385/7244/7250/7281/%E5%B1%85%E7%95%99/36160/),
 but be prepared to provide a criminal background check from your home country and
 a health check (done in Taiwan).

Unusually, you must provide a reason for applying for a TARC. The list of reasons
 and associated document requirements [are here](https://www.immigration.gov.tw/media/42540/相關證明文件一覽表.pdf).

You can skip getting a TARC if:
* you are younger than 20 years old and have parent with active Household Registration
* you were born in Taiwan between February 10th 1989 and February 9th 1999 and your mother had Household Registration (even if your father was not Taiwanese)
* you are descended from a Taiwanese soldier stranded in Thailand or Burma after the civil war (AF391)
